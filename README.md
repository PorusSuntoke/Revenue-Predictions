# Revenue-Predictions
In this project it is assumed that I have an ice-cream business and want to create a model to predict daily revenue in dollars based on temperature.
To solve this problem, I decided to build a simple Artificial Neural Network.
The dataset consists of outside air temperature as input and overall daily revenue generated in dollars.
I have implemented linear regression in this project.
